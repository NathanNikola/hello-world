# hello-world
A short description.
So I'm Nathan and I'm very passionate about I.T and at work I am currently doing all their I.T support for free when I really should be getting paid for it. This is my first step to getting to that place! I love gadgets, games, comics and I am a huge nerd. I'm starting to learn html now so hopefully I can build a career eventually!
